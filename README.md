# Pufferfish

### Why Not Puff?

### `Functions As:`

**Hud Enhances**
- Fluent animations to game titles and etc.;
- Enhanced chat hud visual effects and colorable texts;
- On-screen last death anchor and urmeneta (may be removed in future versions due to inconsistences);
- Flash the screen when taking a screenshot.

**Angle Locks**
- Being able to lock the player's camera cartesian coordinates (pitch angle with the default key `Z`/yaw angle with the default key `V`);
- Press `⌘ + Z` (Windows: `Ctrl + Z`) to flip pitch angle, and press `⌘ + V` (Windows: `Ctrl + V`) to turn right by 90 degrees (`Shift` to invert);
- Double-tap `Z` or `V` to snap to nearest axis.

**New Gadgets**
- Getting tired with the crowded vanilla style hotbar stuffs? Set it vertically to the left of screen and strafe the experience/health/food... bars to the bottom! Surely the expanded space will bring you the spacious feel (suppose you aren't using a super wide screen)! (also, more animations to the hotbar);
- `Deprecated` `Future function` Refreshing the dirt-ly loading screen from nose to tip in a modern way.

- **...And fully customized options to toggle all the functions & values!**
